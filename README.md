The application is developed using spring boot as it is an utility provided by spring for optimised representation of an application be it web or standalone and for integration of different projects together into one.
There are different property files defined for different environments which can be provided as a parameter during runtime or in application.properties we can define the active profile: spring.active.profile=<active-profile>
Also, maven is used for project setup. Hence, the system on which application would be run must haven maven installed into it.
